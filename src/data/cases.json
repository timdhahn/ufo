    "readMore": "Multiple witnesses in Philadelphia described a hard-edged humming sound just after dusk, followed by a small craft that resembled a standing travel case. The object reportedly hovered low over 12th Street near Washington Square before opening along a central seam, revealing a pale interior light and a faint scent like ozone and warm vinyl. Several bystanders claim a figure, called \"Zaddy\" by two separate sources, gestured to a nearby pedestrian, who entered the craft without visible resistance before the object sealed shut and lifted straight up.\n\nAbout 50 minutes later, accounts emerged from Washington, DC describing a similar object descending over a quiet block near the Mall, releasing a single person who appeared disoriented but uninjured. The individual reportedly gave their name and home neighborhood, matching the Philadelphia witness account, then asked whether it was still \"before curfew,\" despite no curfew being in place. A Metro employee on break said the man was \"carrying nothing but a ticket stub that didn't match any current transit route.\"\n\nThe pattern repeated over the next two weekends with near-identical timing, drawing a small crowd of observers in both cities. Audio captured on a phone in Philadelphia contains a steady 92-96 Hz tone during the event. One resident living above the alleged pickup point noted a brief power dip in their apartment, with smart bulbs momentarily flickering as the object departed. Investigators are seeking additional footage from doorbell cameras and traffic feeds to confirm the path and establish the duration of each transit.",
